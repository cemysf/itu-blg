1. INTRODUCTION
	Goal, contents and organization of the document.

2. DATA MODEL
	2.1 General Data Model - Entity relationship diagram for the data that is stored in a database. This diagram should be based on the conceptual model in Requirements Specification document. The relationships between these two models should be explained. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model
	2.2 Important Data Considerations - Information about other data format preferences (Ajax, JSON, XML, etc.).
	2.3 Data Flow - Data Flow Diagram and its explanation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_diagram

3. SOFTWARE MODEL
	3.1 System Architecture - Example: http://www.ipag.ch/sqlf/sqlF_SystemArchitecture.gif
	3.2 Component (Package) Diagram - Inputs, outputs of each component and services should be included. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_diagram
	3.3 Class Diagrams - A class diagram for each component. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram
	3.4 Sequence/Communication Diagrams - One of the two diagrams for each User Story in Requirements Specification. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_diagram

4. USER INTERFACE MODEL
	Important screen mock-ups that are mapped to user stories and project components. 
		Choose 5 to 10 screens to demonstrate. 
		Do not include similar screens multiple times.
		You can use the rapid prototyping tools introduced in Recitation Session 2 as well as any other tools to prepare mock-ups (Bootstrap, Balsamiq, Fluid UI, Proto.io, UXPin etc.).
