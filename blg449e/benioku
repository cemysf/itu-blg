	Ödev Açıklaması

	A reader/writer application will be implemented  to run in a Unix based operating system using C with 2 reader and 2 writer processes 		communicating over a circular list in a shared memory. The first writer writes in only odd numbered cells and only the first reader 		reads these values. Similarly the second writer writes in only even numbered cells and only the second reader reads these values.

	Please note that a testing environment may require a fifth process to check the content of the circular list. 

	No report is required but sufficient inline comments are expected.

	signing out from a server 

	listing the messaging groups 

	signing in/out to/from a messaging group

	sending/automatically receiving messages to/from messaging groups
